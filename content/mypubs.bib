	abstract = {To improve the accuracy of tree reconstruction, phylogeneticists are extracting increasingly large multigene data sets from sequence databases. Determining whether a database contains at least k genes sampled from at least m species is an NP-complete problem. However, the skewed distribution of sequences in these databases permits all such data sets to be obtained in reasonable computing times even for large numbers of sequences. We developed an exact algorithm for obtaining the largest multigene data sets from a collection of sequences. The algorithm was then tested on a set of 100,000 protein sequences of green plants and used to identify the largest multigene ortholog data sets having at least 3 genes and 6 species. The distribution of sizes of these data sets forms a hollow curve, and the largest are surprisingly small, ranging from 62 genes by 6 species, to 3 genes by 65 species, with more symmetrical data sets of around 15 taxa by 15 genes. These upper bounds to sequence concatenation have important implications for building the tree of life from large sequence databases.},

	abstract = {The origin of the arctic flora covering the northernmost treeless areas is still poorly understood. Arctic plants may have evolved in situ or immigrated from the adjacent ecosystems. Frequently arctic species have disjunctive distributions between the Arctic and high mountain systems of the temperate zone. This pattern may result from long distance dispersal or from glacial plant migrations and extinctions of intermediate populations. The hemiparasitic genus Pedicularis is represented in the Arctic by c. 28 taxa and ranks among the six most species-rich vascular plant genera of this region. In this study, we test the hypothesis that these lineages evolved from predecessors occurring in northern temperate mountain ranges, many of which are current centers of diversity for the genus. We generated a nuclear ribosomal and chloroplast DNA phylogeny including almost all of the arctic taxa and nearly half of the genus as a whole. The arctic taxa of Pedicularis evolved 12–14 times independently and are mostly nested in lineages that otherwise occur in the high mountains of Eurasia and North America. It appears that only three arctic lineages arose from the present-day center of diversity of the genus, in the Hengduan Mountains and Himalayas. Two lineages are probably of lowland origin. Arctic taxa of Pedicularis show considerable niche conservatism with respect to soil moisture and grow predominantly in moist to wet soils. The studied characteristics of ecology, morphology, and chromosome numbers of arctic Pedicularis show a heterogeneous pattern of evolution. The directions of morphological changes among the arctic lineages show opposing trends. Arctic taxa are chiefly diploid, the few tetraploid chromosome numbers of the genus were recorded only for arctic taxa. Five arctic Pedicularis are annuals or biennials, life forms otherwise rare in the Arctic. Other genera of the Orobanchaceae consist also of an elevated number of short-lived species, thus hemiparasitism may favor this life form in the Arctic.},

The sister group of Circaea was recently shown to be Fuchsia, which comprises 107 species primarily distributed in montane Central and South America, including four species occurring in the South Pacific islands. Three plastid markers (petB-petD, rpl16, and trnL-F) and nrITS sequences from 13 of the 14 taxa of Circaea were sequenced and used to reconstruct the phylogenetic and biogeographic history of the genus. Parsimony and Bayesian analyses support that (1) Circaea is monophyletic; (2) the bilocular group is a weakly supported clade nested within the unilocular grade; (3) neither the C. alpina complex nor the C. canadensis complex is monophyletic; and (4) the western North American C. alpina subsp. pacifica diverged first in the genus. Divergence time estimates based on the Bayesian "relaxed" clock methods suggest that the earliest Circaea divergence occurred minimally at 16.17 mya (95\% HPD: 7.69-24.53 mya). Biogeographic analyses using divergence-vicariance analysis (DIVA) and a likelihood method support the New World origin of Circaea. Three independent dispersal events between Eurasia and North America via the Bering land bridge were inferred within Circaea. Higher taxon diversity of Circaea in eastern Asia was probably caused by geologic and ecological changes during the late Tertiary in the Northern Hemisphere.},

By integrating molecular phylogeny, historical biogeography and palaeoecology, we test a bold hypothesis proposed by Vladimir Nabokov regarding the origin of Neotropical Polyommatus blue butterflies, and show that Beringia has served as a biological corridor for the dispersal of these insects from Asia into the New World. We present a novel method to estimate ancestral temperature tolerances using distribution range limits of extant organisms, and find that climatic conditions in Beringia acted as a decisive filter in determining which taxa crossed into the New World during five separate invasions over the past 11 Myr. Our results reveal a marked effect of the Miocene–Pleistocene global cooling, and demonstrate that palaeoclimatic conditions left a strong signal on the ecology of present-day taxa in the New World. The phylogenetic conservatism in thermal tolerances that we have identified may permit the reconstruction of the palaeoecology of ancestral organisms, especially mobile taxa that can easily escape from hostile environments rather than adapt to them.},

We used a combination of field and molecular approaches to test the hypothesis that serpentine fungal communities are species-poor and specialized. We conducted surveys of ectomycorrhizal fungal diversity from adjacent serpentine and non-serpentine sites, described fungal communities using nrDNA Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) fragment and sequence analyses, and compared their phylogenetic community structure. Although we detected low fungal overlap across the two habitats, we found serpentine soils to support rich fungal communities that include representatives from all major fungal lineages. We failed to detect the phylogenetic signature of endemic clades that would result from specialization and adaptive radiation within this habitat.



Our results indicate that serpentine soils do not constitute an extreme environment for ectomycorrhizal fungi, and raise important questions about the role of symbioses in edaphic tolerance and the maintenance of biodiversity.},

Here, we introduce a likelihood-based approach to estimating region-dependent rates of speciation, extinction, and range evolution from a phylogeny, using a new model in which these processes are interdependent. We demonstrate the method with simulation tests that accurately recover parameters relating to the mode of speciation and source–sink dynamics. We then apply it to the evolution of habitat occupancy in Californian plant communities, where we find higher rates of speciation in chaparral than in forests and evidence for expanding habitat tolerances.},

	abstract = {The Hengduan Mountains region of south-west China is a noted biodiversity hotspot, but the geographic origins and historical assembly of its rich endemic flora, including the sky-island species of Solms-laubachia Muschl. (Brassicaceae), have been little studied. Previous molecular studies on the phylogeny of Solms-laubachia showed it to be paraphyletic, leading to considerable expansion not only of its taxonomic limits, but also its geographic range, with the inclusion of taxa from outside the Hengduan region. However, these studies provided little resolution of interspecific relationships, preventing inferences about historical biogeography within the clade. In the present study, new sequence data from two nuclear genes (LEAFY and G3pdh) and two chloroplast intergenic spacers (petN2013psbM and psbM2013trnD) were combined with existing markers to increase phylogenetic signals. Phaeonychium villosum (Maxim.) Al-Shehbaz was found to be nested within Solms-laubachia s.l. In general, phylogenetic relationships appear to be a good predictor of geography, with the Hengduan Mountain endemics embedded in a paraphyletic grade of species from the western Himalayas and central Asia, but they also imply morphological homoplasy. Incongruence was detected between the nuclear and chloroplast gene trees, perhaps resulting from incomplete lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphisms. The crown age of Solms-laubachia s.l. was estimated to be approximately 1.4220133.68 mya, using Bayesian relaxed molecular clock analysis. Historical biogeographic analysis using a parametric dispersal2013extinction2013cladogenesis model inferred central Asia and the western Himalayas as most probable ancestral range of Solms-laubachia s.l., and estimated higher rates of eastward expansion than westward during the diversification of descendant lineages. In summary, our results suggest that Solms-laubachia s.l. originated during the Pliocene in central Asia, and subsequently migrated eastward into the Hengduan Mountains, colonizing sky-island, alpine scree-slope habitats that may have provided novel ecological opportunity and accelerated speciation, ultimately establishing this region as the present center of diversity of the genus.},

This research was executed by interviewing healers about plants used traditionally to treat the symptoms of TB. Samples of some of the plants were collected, and extracts of 77 species were submitted to various in vitro assays in order to determine the amount of growth inhibition of virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv (Mtb), as opposed to other microbes and mammalian Vero cells.
Interviews took place with 58 contemporary healers in 5 different provinces about plants currently used, giving a list of 341 plants.

	abstract = {Migratory species exhibit seasonal variation in their geographic ranges, often inhabiting geographically and ecologically distinct breeding and nonbreeding areas. The complicated geography of seasonal migration has long posed a challenge for inferring the geographic origins of migratory species as well as evolutionary sequences of change in migratory behavior. To address this challenge, we developed a phylogenetic model of the joint evolution of breeding and nonbreeding (winter) ranges and applied it to the inference of biogeographic history in the emberizoid passerine birds. We found that seasonal migration between breeding ranges in North America and winter ranges in the Neotropics evolved primarily via shifts of winter ranges toward the tropics from ancestral ranges in North America. This result contrasts with a dominant paradigm that hypothesized migration evolving out of the tropics via shifts of the breeding ranges. We also show that major lineages of tropical, sedentary emberizoids are derived from northern, migratory ancestors. In these lineages, the winter ranges served as a biogeographic conduit for temperate-to-tropical colonization: winter-range shifts toward the tropics during the evolution of long-distance migration often preceded southward shifts of breeding ranges, the loss of migration, and in situ tropical diversification. Meanwhile, the evolution of long-distance migration enabled the persistence of old lineages in North America. These results illuminate how the evolution of seasonal migration has contributed to greater niche conservatism among tropical members of this diverse avian radiation.},

	abstract = {In disciplines such as macroevolution that are not amenable to experimentation, scientists usually rely on current observations to test hypotheses about historical events, assuming that “the present is the key to the past.” Biogeographers, for example, used this assumption to reconstruct ancestral ranges from the distribution of extant species. Yet, under scenarios of high extinction rates, the biodiversity we observe today might not be representative of the historical diversity and this could result in incorrect biogeographic reconstructions. Here, we introduce a new approach to incorporate into biogeographic inference the temporal, spatial, and environmental information provided by the fossil record, as a direct evidence of the extinct biodiversity fraction. First, inferences of ancestral ranges for those nodes in the phylogeny calibrated with the fossil record are constrained to include the geographic distribution of the fossil. Second, we use fossil distribution and past climate data to reconstruct the climatic preferences and potential distribution of ancestral lineages over time, and use this information to build a biogeographic model that takes into account “ecological connectivity” through time. To show the power of this approach, we reconstruct the biogeographic history of the large angiosperm genus Hypericum, which has a fossil record extending back to the Early Cenozoic. Unlike previous reconstructions based on extant species distributions, our results reveal that Hypericum stem lineages were already distributed in the Holarctic before diversification of its crown-group, and that the geographic distribution of the genus has been relatively stable throughout the climatic oscillations of the Cenozoic. Geographical movement was mediated by the existence of climatic corridors, like Beringia, whereas the equatorial tropical belt acted as a climatic barrier, preventing Hypericum lineages to reach the southern temperate regions. Our study shows that an integrative approach to historical biogeography—that combines sources of evidence as diverse as paleontology, ecology, and phylogenetics—could help us obtain more accurate reconstructions of ancient evolutionary history. It also reveals the confounding effect different rates of extinction across regions have in biogeography, sometimes leading to ancestral areas being erroneously inferred as recent colonization events.},

The paucity of homologous character data across disparately related lineages currently renders direct phylogenetic inference untenable. To reconstruct a comprehensive tree of life, we therefore synthesized published phylogenies, together with taxonomic classifications for taxa never incorporated into a phylogeny. We present a draft tree containing 2.3 million tips—the Open Tree of Life. Realization of this tree required the assembly of two additional community resources: (i) a comprehensive global reference taxonomy and (ii) a database of published phylogenetic trees mapped to this taxonomy. Our open source framework facilitates community comment and contribution, enabling the tree to be continuously updated when new phylogenetic and taxonomic data become digitally available. Although data coverage and phylogenetic conflict across the Open Tree of Life illuminate gaps in both the underlying data available for phylogenetic reconstruction and the publication of trees as digital objects, the tree provides a compelling starting point for community contribution. This comprehensive tree will fuel fundamental research on the nature of biological diversity, ultimately providing up-to-date phylogenies for downstream applications in comparative biology, ecology, conservation biology, climate change, agriculture, and genomics.},

	abstract = {Biogeography is a multidisciplinary science concerned with how and why organisms are distributed as they are on Earth. It links fields such as systematics, ecology, paleontology, and climatology, and occupies a central position in evolutionary biology, being fundamental to the study of processes such as speciation and adaptive radiation. Here we provide a brief overview of some particularly dynamic areas of inquiry and offer some perspectives on future directions for the field. We hope that some historical debates, such as those over the importance of dispersal, or the validity of molecular dating, are finally being put to rest. Over the last decade, biogeography has become increasingly integrative, and has benefited from advances in statistical methods for inferring geographic range dynamics in a phylogenetic context, molecular estimation of lineage divergence times, and modeling lineage birth and death. These are enabling greater insights into patterns of organismal diversification in time and space. In the next decade, analytical challenges are emerging on several fronts. For example, phylogenies are increasing in size and taxonomic breadth and new sequencing technologies enabling phylogenetic and phylogeographic datasets are increasingly genomic in depth. In addition, geographic occurrence data are accumulating in online repositories, yet tools for data mining and synthetic analysis are lacking for comparative multi-lineage studies. Biogeography is thus entering an era characterized by phylogenomic datasets, increasingly comprehensive sampling of clades, and interdisciplinary synthesis. We anticipate continued progress in our understanding of biodiversity patterns at regional and global scales, but this will likely require greater collaboration with specialists in bioinformatics and computational science. Finally, it is clear that biogeography has an increasingly important role to play in the discovery and conservation of biodiversity. Lessons learned from biogeographic studies of islands are being applied to better understand extinction dynamics as continental ecosystems become more fragmented, and phylogeography and ecological niche modeling offer innovative paths toward the discovery of previously unknown species distributions and priority areas for conservation. The future of biogeography is bright and filled with exciting challenges and opportunities.},

	abstract = {In historical biogeography, model-based inference methods for reconstructing the evolution of geographic ranges on phylogenetic trees are poorly developed relative to the diversity of analogous methods available for inferring character evolution. We attempt to rectify this deficiency by constructing a dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis (DEC) model for geographic range evolution that specifies instantaneous transition rates between discrete states (ranges) along phylogenetic branches and apply it to estimating likelihoods of ancestral states (range inheritance scenarios) at cladogenesis events. Unlike an earlier version of this approach, the present model allows for an analytical solution to probabilities of range transitions as a function of time, enabling free parameters in the model, rates of dispersal, and local extinction to be estimated by maximum likelihood. Simulation results indicate that accurate parameter estimates may be difficult to obtain in practice but also show that ancestral range inheritance scenarios nevertheless can be correctly recovered with high success if rates of range evolution are low relative to the rate of cladogenesis. We apply the DEC model to a previously published, exemplary case study of island biogeography involving Hawaiian endemic angiosperms in Psychotria (Rubiaceae), showing how the DEC model can be iteratively refined from inspecting inferences of range evolution and also how geological constraints involving times of island origin may be imposed on the likelihood function. The DEC model is sufficiently similar to character models that it might serve as a gateway through which many existing comparative methods for characters could be imported into the realm of historical biogeography; moreover, it might also inspire the conceptual expansion of character models toward inclusion of evolutionary change as directly coincident, either as cause or consequence, with cladogenesis events. The DEC model is thus an incremental advance that highlights considerable potential in the nascent field of model-based historical biogeographic inference.},

Life history theory predicts that the evolution of floral display is constrained by trade-offs between the size and number of flowers and inflorescences. Indeed, a trade-off between flower size and flower number is a key assumption of models of inflorescence architecture and the evolution of floral display. Surprisingly, however, empirical evidence for the trade-off is limited. In particular, there is a lack of phylogenetic evidence for a trade-off between flower size and number. Analyses of phylogenetic independent contrasts (PICs) of 251 angiosperm species spanning 63 families yielded a significant negative correlation between flower size and flower number. At smaller phylogenetic scales, analyses of individual genera did not always find evidence of a trade-off, a result consistent with previous studies that have examined the trade-off for a single species or genus. Ours is the first study to support an angiosperm-wide trade-off between flower size and number and supports the theory that life history constraints have influenced the evolution of floral display.},

At Las Cruces Biological Station, the population of P. padifolia is composed of equal numbers of pin and thrum plants and morphs are randomly distributed. Like the majority of distylous species, P. padifolia exhibits a self- and intramorph-incompatible mating system. The analysis of stigmatic pollen loads obtained from emasculated flowers shows that pollen flow between floral morphs is disassortative, which supports the Darwinian hypothesis concerning the adaptive significance of heterostyly. Pins experience greater disassortative pollination than thrums. Pins also set more seed than thrums, suggesting that the higher frequency of compatible pollen deposited on pin stigmas results in greater fecundity; alternatively, greater seed set in pins could be due to the differential allocation of resources to male and female function between morphs. Overall, seed set for the Las Cruces population of P. padifolia is much lower than the potential maximum. Factors which could contribute to seed set limitation include the frequency and/or spatial pattern of pollinator visits, pollen availability, and resource availability.},

	abstract = {An analysis of the molecular evolution of two LEGCYC paralogs in Lupinus (Genisteae: Leguminosae) reveals a varied history of site-specific and lineage-specific evolutionary rates and selection both within and between loci. LEGCYC genes are homologous to regulatory loci known to control floral symmetry and adaxial flower organ identity in Antirrhinum and its relatives. Within Lupinus, L. densiflorus is unusual in having flowers with a proportionally smaller standard (fused adaxial petals) and larger wings (lateral petals) than other lupin species. Phylogenetic estimates of the nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate ratio, \{omega\}, suggest that along the L. densiflorus lineage, positive selection ([IMG]f1.gif" BORDER="0"{\textgreater} {\textgreater} 1) acted at some codon sites of one paralog, LEGCYC1B, and greater purifying selection ([IMG]f1.gif" BORDER="0"{\textgreater} {\textless} 1) acted at some sites of the other paralog, LEGCYC1A. Overall, LEGCYC1A appears to be evolving faster than LEGCYC1B, and both paralogs are evolving faster than the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nr DNA. The predominant historical pattern inferred is a highly heterogeneous "selectional mosaic" which we suggest may be typical of the teosinte branched 1-cycloidea-PCF (TCP) class of transcriptional activators, and possibly other genes. Codon models that do not account for both site-specific and lineage-specific variation in \{omega\} do not detect positive selection at these loci. We suggest a modification of existing branch-site models involving an additional \{omega\} parameter along the foreground branch, to account for the effects of both greater positive selection and greater purifying selection at different codon sites along a particular branch. The higher rates of evolution and congruent phylogenetic signal of both LEGCYC paralogs show promise for the use of these genes as markers for phylogeny reconstruction at low taxonomic levels in Genisteae.},

	abstract = {At a time when historical biogeography appears to be again expanding its scope after a period of focusing primarily on discerning area relationships using cladograms, new inference methods are needed to bring more kinds of data to bear on questions about the geographic history of lineages. Here we describe a likelihood framework for inferring the evolution of geographic range on phylogenies that models lineage dispersal and local extinction in a set of discrete areas as stochastic events in continuous time. Unlike existing methods for estimating ancestral areas, such as dispersal-vicariance analysis, this approach incorporates information on the timing of both lineage divergences and the availability of connections between areas (dispersal routes). Monte Carlo methods are used to estimate branch-specific transition probabilities for geographic ranges, enabling the likelihood of the data (observed species distributions) to be evaluated for a given phylogeny and parameterized paleogeographic model. We demonstrate how the method can be used to address two biogeographic questions: What were the ancestral geographic ranges on a phylogenetic tree? How were those ancestral ranges affected by speciation and inherited by the daughter lineages at cladogenesis events? For illustration we use hypothetical examples and an analysis of a Northern Hemisphere plant clade (Cercis), comparing and contrasting inferences to those obtained from dispersal-vicariance analysis. Although the particular model we implement is somewhat simplistic, the framework itself is flexible and could readily be modified to incorporate additional sources of information and also be extended to address other aspects of historical biogeography.},

	abstract = {The Neotropics contains half of remaining rainforests and Earth's largest reservoir of amphibian biodiversity. However, determinants of Neotropical biodiversity (i.e., vicariance, dispersals, extinctions, and radiations) earlier than the Quaternary are largely unstudied. Using a novel method of ancestral area reconstruction and relaxed Bayesian clock analyses, we reconstructed the biogeography of the poison frog clade (Dendrobatidae). We rejected an Amazonian center-of-origin in favor of a complex connectivity model expanding over the Neotropics. We inferred 14 dispersals into and 18 out of Amazonia to adjacent regions; the Andes were the major source of dispersals into Amazonia. We found three episodes of lineage dispersal with two interleaved periods of vicariant events between South and Central America. During the late Miocene, Amazonian, and Central American-Chocoan lineages significantly increased their diversity compared to the Andean and Guianan-Venezuelan-Brazilian Shield counterparts. Significant percentage of dendrobatid diversity in Amazonia and Chocó resulted from repeated immigrations, with radiations at {\textless}10.0 million years ago (MYA), rather than in situ diversification. In contrast, the Andes, Venezuelan Highlands, and Guiana Shield have undergone extended in situ diversification at near constant rate since the Oligocene. The effects of Miocene paleogeographic events on Neotropical diversification dynamics provided the framework under which Quaternary patterns of endemism evolved.},

	abstract = {Island systems have long been useful models for understanding lineage diversification in a geographic context, especially pertaining to the importance of dispersal in the origin of new clades. Here we use a well-resolved phylogeny of the flowering plant genus Cyrtandra (Gesneriaceae) from the Pacific Islands to compare four methods of inferring ancestral geographic ranges in islands: two developed for character-state reconstruction that allow only single-island ranges and do not explicitly associate speciation with range evolution (Fitch parsimony [FP; parsimony-based] and stochastic mapping [SM; likelihood-based]) and two methods developed specifically for ancestral range reconstruction, in which widespread ranges (spanning islands) are integral to inferences about speciation scenarios (dispersal-vicariance analysis [DIVA; parsimony-based] and dispersal-extinction-cladogenesis [DEC; likelihood-based]). The methods yield conflicting results, which we interpret in light of their respective assumptions. FP exhibits the least power to unequivocally reconstruct ranges, likely due to a combination of having flat (uninformative) transition costs and not using branch length information. SM reconstructions generally agree with a prior hypothesis about dispersal-driven speciation across the Pacific, despite the conceptual mismatch between its character-based model and this mode of range evolution. In contrast with narrow extant ranges for species of Cyrtandra, DIVA reconstructs broad ancestral ranges at many nodes. DIVA results also conflict with geological information on island ages; we attribute these conflicts to the parsimony criterion not considering branch lengths or time, as well as vicariance being the sole means of divergence for widespread ancestors. DEC analyses incorporated geological information on island ages and allowed prior hypotheses about range size and dispersal rates to be evaluated in a likelihood framework and gave more nuanced inferences about...

	abstract = {Assumptions about the costs of character change, coded in the form of a step matrix, determine most-parsimonious inferences of character evolution on phylogenies. We present a graphical approach to exploring the relationship between cost assumptions and evolutionary inferences from character data. The number of gains and losses of a binary trait on a phylogeny can be plotted over a range of cost assumptions, to reveal the inflection point at which there is a switch from more gains to more losses and the point at which all changes are inferred to be in one direction or the other. Phylogenetic structure in the data, the tree shape, and the relative frequency of states among the taxa influence the shape of such graphs and complicate the interpretation of possible permutationbased tests for directionality of change. The costs at which the most-parsimonious state of each internal node switches from one state to another can also be quantified by iterative ancestral-state reconstruction over a range of costs. This procedure helps identify the most robust inferences of change in each direction, which should be of use in designing comparative studies.

However, there also appear to have been reversals to actinomorphy. A few evolutionarily derived actinomorphic flowers resemble mutants caused by loss-of-function mutations in genes such as CYCLOIDEA. However, a majority of the shifts from zygomorphy to actinomorphy appear to have entailed a reduction in petal number and flower size, implying a mechanism other than loss of CYCLOIDEA function. Within the Asteridae there appear to be three common forms of zygomorphy. An explanation for the virtual absence of other forms rests on the near universality of the basic orientation of the flower in the Asteridae.},

	abstract = {In historical biogeography, phylogenetic trees have long been used as tools for addressing a wide range of inference problems, from explaining common distribution patterns of species to reconstructing ancestral geographic ranges on branches of the tree of life. However, the potential utility of phylogenies for this purpose has yet to be fully realized, due in part to a lack of explicit conceptual links between processes underlying the evolution of geographic ranges and processes of phylogenetic tree growth. We suggest that statistical approaches that use parametric models to forge such links will stimulate integration and propel hypothesis-driven biogeographical inquiry in new directions. We highlight here two such approaches and describe how they represent early steps towards a more general framework for model-based historical biogeography that is based on likelihood as an optimality criterion, rather than having the traditional reliance on parsimony. The development of this framework will not be without significant challenges, particularly in balancing model complexity with statistical power, and these will be most apparent in studies of regions with many component areas and complex geological histories, such as the Mediterranean Basin.},

This can work well for ancient, unreversed traits and for correlating multiple trait origins with higher diversification rates, but it is less suitable for unique events, recently evolved innovations, and traits that exhibit homoplasy. Here I present a new method for detecting the phylogenetic signature of key innovations that tests whether the evolutionary history of the candidate trait is associated with shorter waiting times between cladogenesis events. The method employs stochastic models of character evolution and cladogenesis and integrates well into a Bayesian framework in which uncertainty in historical inferences (such as phylogenetic relationships) is allowed. Applied to a well-known example in plants, nectar spurs in columbines, the method gives much stronger support to the key innovation hypothesis than previous tests.},
