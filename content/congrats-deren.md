Lab alum [Deren Eaton](http://dereneaton.com/) will be joining the
Ecology and Evolution faculty at Columbia University in NYC! Deren's
work since leaving the lab has focused on the use of RADseq in
systematics and evolutionary research, especially via development of
[pyRAD](http://dereneaton.com/software/pyrad) and related software.

Let's hope he finds time to finish up some lingering papers from his
dissertation...
